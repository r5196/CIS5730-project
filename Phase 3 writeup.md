# Phase 3 writeup
## Q1
The Additional Tasks that you would like graded for this phase (**3.1-3.4**).

## Q2
For each task you completed in this phase, a brief description of the changes you made to the provided code, e.g. the names of any classes or methods that were changed, new methods that were created, etc.
1. **Task 3.1 adds createOrg() method in data manager class. The task also changes main() method in userinterface class. The task finally adds /creatOrg endpoint in api.js. Task 3.1 checks if any field is blank in createOrg() method in data manager classs. In the case, the method will throw exception and indicate the field is invalid. The task checks if the org login already exists using /createOrg endpoint in api.js.**
2. **Task 3.2 adds updateOrg method in data manager class. The task also changes main() method in user interface by adding change password method. Finally the task adds /updateOrg endpoint in api.js.**

3. **Task 3.3 adds verifyOrgPassword() and updateAccountInfo() methods in DataManager class, and editOrgAccountInfo() in the UserInterface class. By adding those methods, the Organzation app allows the user to edit the account information. The corresponding unit tests have also been added. In addition, setName() and setDescription() methods were added in Organization class. Moreover, 2 new endpoints, /verifyOrgPassword and /updateOrgAccount, were added in admin/api.js.**
   - Note: the users will be given chances of updating the account information till they specifically enter "no". After entering "no", they will then be able to see the menu that allows them to view funds, etc. 
5. **Task 3.4 adds makeDonation methond in DataManager class and makeDonations() in UserInterface class. MakeDonations() methods deals with normal donation process and also situations when fund id and contributor id are not existed, donation amount is less than 0 or is not a number, all inputs are null, etc. During these situations, users are allowed to retry. makedonation_test file is also added to test all features for makedonation function.**



## Q3
Any known bugs or other issues with the tasks you attempted in this phase.
Task 3.3
   - The task requirement states that "If the user successfully edits their account info, they should see a message indicating so and see the menu that allows them to view funds, create a new fund, etc.". **However**, we believe it would be more reasonable to inquire if the user wishes to continue modifying their account information before presenting the fund options. This approach enables the user to make further updates until they are satisfied. Once the user responds with "no" to the prompt, "Do you want to edit org account information? (Yes/No)," they will then gain access to the fund options.
   - Two endpoints were added for they serve different purposes and involve distinct operations. The /updateOrgAccount endpoint is responsible for updating the organization's account information, such as name and description. On the other hand, the /verifyOrgPassword endpoint is used to verify the organization's password. By keeping these endpoints separate, the code remains more modular and follows the principle of single responsibility. This separation allows for better code organization and maintainability in the long run. Additionally, separating the endpoints provides flexibility if there is a need to enhance or modify each functionality independently in the future. Therefore, we chose to add two endpoints instead of one.

## Q4
Instructions on how to start each app, if you changed anything from the original version of the code, e.g. the name of the Java main class or JavaScript entry point, arguments to the programs, etc. If you did not change anything, you may omit this.

- **Before, to run the program, you should run the UserInterface class, and pass the login ID and password that you created for an organization via the Admin app as the runtime arguments to the main method.**
```
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		DataManager ds = new DataManager(new WebClient("localhost", 3001));
		
		String login = args[0];
		String password = args[1];
```

- **Now, to run the program, you should run the UserInterface class, but do not need to pass the login ID and password as the runtime arguments to the main method. The program will now ask you to enter the login ID and password that you created for an organization via the Admin app after the program runs.**
```
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		DataManager ds = new DataManager(new WebClient("localhost", 3001));
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

		while (true) {
			System.out.print("Enter your login: ");
			String login = in.nextLine().trim();
			System.out.print("Enter your password: ");
			String password = in.nextLine().trim();
```

# Phase 2 writeup
## Q1
The Additional Tasks that you would like graded for this phase (**2.1 - 2.3, 2.7 - 2.9**).

## Q2
1. **Task 2.1 changes get contributor name method in data manager class and adds private field and initialize it in constructor. The task also requirs changes to orignial tests in phase 1. In the method, if the contributor id has been looked up, directly return its name, if it has not been looked up, before return its name, add the id and its name to the cache.**
3. **Task 2.2 changes each method in data manager file to pass robustness test cases. The task also requirs changes to orignial tests in phase 1. Finally the userinterface is changed to make UI display meaningful error message. After message, the user has the option of retrying the operation. This involes changes of each operation in userinterface class.**
5. **Task 2.3 changes displayFund() method in UserInterface.java. Users have two option in this method, chioce 1 is for listing individual contributors and their donation, choice 2 is for listing donations aggregated by contributor. In option 2, a donationMap is created to store the aggregated donation data.The map uses contributor's name as the key and an ArrayList as the value, it stores the donation count(index 0) and total donation amount(index 1) for each contributor. 
A PriorityQueue named pq is created to store the donation entries in descending order based on the total donation amouont. Then a cachemap is created as a glocal instance to do the cache. After processing all donationos, the calculated donationMap is added to the cacheMap for future use. Finally, the method iterates over the entries in the pq and display the contributor, donation times and total donation amount.**
7. **Task 2.7 adds a new function called 'deleteFund' in DataManager.java. This function connects to the /deleteFund API endpoint, allowing the user to delete the fund corresponding to the fundId. The respective unit test file named 'DataManager_deleteFund_Test' has also been added. In addition, the UserInterface.java has been updated: When a fund is displayed, the user would be given the option to delete the fund by entering the correct number. To ensure the fund would not be deleted through mistake, the user is prompted to enter "I CONFIRM" to proceed with the deletion.**
8. **Task 2.8 changes the start() method in user interface class. It has the option of logging out when variable option is set to -1. It also changes the way of starting app in main() method. This is in Q4. The change asks you to log back in.**
9. **Task 2.9 creates a allContributor() methond in UserInterface.java and adds a totalday() method in Donation.java. A new contributorMap is declared to store the  donation data for each contributor. For each donation, the method checks if the contributorMap already contains an entry for the contributor. If not, a new entry is created using the contributor's name as the key and an ArrayList containing the fund name, donation amount, donation date, and total days. If the contributorMap already contains an entry for the contributor, a new key is generated by appending the i value to handle multiple donations from the same contributor. The entry is then added to the contributorMap. A PriorityQueue named pq is created to order the contributor's donation by the date, the totalday() method is used to caclutate the totaldays. Finally, the contributor's name, donation amount, donation date, and fund name are printed for each entry.**


## Q3
Any known bugs or other issues with the tasks you attempted in this phase.

## Q4
Instructions on how to start each app, if you changed anything from the original version of the code, e.g. the name of the Java main class or JavaScript entry point, arguments to the programs, etc. If you did not change anything, you may omit this.

- **Before, to run the program, you should run the UserInterface class, and pass the login ID and password that you created for an organization via the Admin app as the runtime arguments to the main method.**
```
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		DataManager ds = new DataManager(new WebClient("localhost", 3001));
		
		String login = args[0];
		String password = args[1];
```

- **Now, to run the program, you should run the UserInterface class, but do not need to pass the login ID and password as the runtime arguments to the main method. The program will now ask you to enter the login ID and password that you created for an organization via the Admin app after the program runs.**
```
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		DataManager ds = new DataManager(new WebClient("localhost", 3001));
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

		while (true) {
			System.out.print("Enter your login: ");
			String login = in.nextLine().trim();
			System.out.print("Enter your password: ");
			String password = in.nextLine().trim();
```

# Phase 2 writeup
## Q1
The Additional Tasks that you would like graded for this phase (**2.1 - 2.3, 2.7 - 2.9**).

## Q2
1. **Task 2.2 adds more unit tests to DataManager_createFund_Tests.java to prevent any invalid inputs or the circumstances that would lead to the failure of creating funds.

These are the unit tests for the getContributorName and attemptLogin method in the DataManager.java file.**

## Q4

## Q5

# Phase 2 writeup
## Q1
The Additional Tasks that you would like graded for this phase (**2.1 - 2.3, 2.4 - 2.6**).

## Q2
1. **Task 2.2 adds more unit tests to DataManager_createFund_Tests.java to prevent any invalid inputs or the circumstances that would lead to the failure of creating funds. It also adds two files named DataManager_getContributorName_Test.java and DataManager_attemptLogin_Test.java. These are the unit tests for the getContributorName and attemptLogin method in the DataManager.java file.**

## Q4
Instructions on how to start each app, if you changed anything from the original version of the code, e.g. the name of the Java main class or JavaScript entry point, arguments to the programs, etc. If you did not change anything, you may omit this.

## Q5
A brief but specific description of each team member’s contributions, including the task numbers that they worked on. Please do not simply write “all members contributed equally to all tasks” since we know that’s not really the case. 😁
